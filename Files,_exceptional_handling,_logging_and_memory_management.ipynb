        "### 1. **What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?**\n",
        "   - **Interpreted languages**: In interpreted languages (like Python), the code is executed line-by-line by an interpreter, without the need for prior compilation. This means the program is translated into machine code at runtime.\n",
        "   - **Compiled languages**: In compiled languages (like C or Java), the source code is first translated into machine code (binary) by a compiler, and then the compiled code is executed. This results in faster execution after compilation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **What is exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "   - Exception handling in Python is a mechanism to handle runtime errors (exceptions) gracefully. It allows the program to continue execution or terminate cleanly instead of crashing when an error occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **What is the purpose of the `finally` block in exception handling?**\n",
        "   - The `finally` block is used to execute code that must run regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It is typically used for cleanup activities like closing files or releasing resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. **What is logging in Python?**\n",
        "   - Logging in Python is a mechanism to track events and errors that occur during program execution. The `logging` module provides a flexible framework for writing log messages that can help with debugging and monitoring applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. **What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?**\n",
        "   - The `__del__` method in Python is a destructor method used to clean up an object before it is destroyed. It is called when an object is about to be garbage collected. It is typically used for resource management, such as closing files or releasing network connections.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **What is the difference between `import` and `from ... import` in Python?**\n",
        "   - `import module`: This imports the entire module, and you need to prefix functions, classes, etc., with the module name.\n",
        "   - `from module import something`: This imports only the specified function, class, or variable, and you can use it directly without the module name prefix.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. **How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?**\n",
        "   - You can handle multiple exceptions by using multiple `except` blocks or by using a tuple to catch multiple exceptions in a single `except` block:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     try:\n",
        "         # code\n",
        "     except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:\n",
        "         # handle errors\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. **What is the purpose of the `with` statement when handling files in Python?**\n",
        "   - The `with` statement simplifies resource management, like opening and closing files. It ensures that the file is properly closed after the block of code is executed, even if an exception occurs within the block.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. **What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?**\n",
        "   - **Multithreading**: It involves running multiple threads within a single process. Threads share memory space and are suited for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
        "   - **Multiprocessing**: It involves running multiple processes, each with its own memory space. It is more suitable for CPU-bound tasks as it can take full advantage of multiple CPU cores.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10. **What are the advantages of using logging in a program?**\n",
        "   - **Traceability**: It helps track events, errors, and program flow.\n",
        "   - **Debugging**: Provides valuable information for debugging issues.\n",
        "   - **Persistent logs**: Logs can be stored in files or databases for future reference.\n",
        "   - **Granular control**: Different logging levels allow filtering of logs based on importance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 11. **What is memory management in Python?**\n",
        "   - Memory management in Python involves the allocation and deallocation of memory for objects. Python uses automatic memory management through a garbage collection system to free memory used by objects that are no longer needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 12. **What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?**\n",
        "   1. **Try block**: Code that may raise an exception is placed in the `try` block.\n",
        "   2. **Except block**: If an exception occurs, control is transferred to the `except` block, which handles the error.\n",
        "   3. **Finally block**: Executes cleanup code regardless of whether an exception occurred.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 13. **Why is memory management important in Python?**\n",
        "   - Efficient memory management ensures that the program runs optimally and does not run out of memory. It also prevents memory leaks, which can degrade performance or cause crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 14. **What is the role of `try` and `except` in exception handling?**\n",
        "   - **Try**: The block where you write code that may raise an exception.\n",
        "   - **Except**: The block that handles the exception if it occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 15. **How does Python's garbage collection system work?**\n",
        "   - Python uses reference counting and cyclic garbage collection to automatically manage memory. When an objectâ€™s reference count drops to zero (i.e., no more references to the object exist), the memory is freed. The garbage collector also identifies and collects objects involved in circular references.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 16. **What is the purpose of the `else` block in exception handling?**\n",
        "   - The `else` block is executed if no exception is raised in the `try` block. It is typically used for code that should only run if the `try` block is successful.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 17. **What are the common logging levels in Python?**\n",
        "   - `DEBUG`: Detailed information, typically useful for diagnosing problems.\n",
        "   - `INFO`: General information about the application's operation.\n",
        "   - `WARNING`: Indicates something unexpected happened but does not prevent the program from continuing.\n",
        "   - `ERROR`: A more serious issue that prevents part of the program from functioning.\n",
        "   - `CRITICAL`: A very serious error that may cause the program to terminate.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 18. **What is the difference between `os.fork()` and multiprocessing in Python?**\n",
        "   - `os.fork()` creates a child process by duplicating the current process, and it is available only on Unix-like systems.\n",
        "   - **Multiprocessing**: Involves creating separate processes with their own memory space, and it works cross-platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 19. **What is the importance of closing a file in Python?**\n",
        "   - Closing a file ensures that all data is written to disk and releases system resources. It prevents file corruption and resource leakage.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 20. **What is the difference between `file.read()` and `file.readline()` in Python?**\n",
        "   - `file.read()`: Reads the entire content of the file as a single string.\n",
        "   - `file.readline()`: Reads one line from the file at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 21. **What is the logging module in Python used for?**\n",
        "   - The `logging` module is used to log messages from an application, including errors, warnings, and other significant events.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 22. **What is the `os` module in Python used for in file handling?**\n",
        "   - The `os` module provides functions for interacting with the operating system, such as file and directory manipulation (e.g., `os.remove()`, `os.rename()`, `os.mkdir()`).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 23. **What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?**\n",
        "   - **Garbage collection overhead**: The automatic garbage collection process can sometimes add overhead, especially when dealing with circular references.\n",
        "   - **Memory leaks**: Improper handling of objects or circular references can lead to memory not being freed properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 24. **How do you raise an exception manually in Python?**\n",
        "   - You can raise an exception using the `raise` keyword:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     raise ValueError(\"This is an error\")\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "### 25. **Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?**\n",
        "   - Multithreading allows multiple tasks to run concurrently, which can improve performance in I/O-bound operations (e.g., file handling, network operations), making the program more efficient and responsive."
